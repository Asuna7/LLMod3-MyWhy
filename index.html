                <p>Welcome to My Why page. Here I explain what is meant by the "why" and talk a bit about my own why.</p>
                <p>Nothing in life just comes to us. We have to work hard and practice all the while aknowledging we are not perfect beings. We will stumble and the pressure will feel heavy on our shoulders. Here enter the "why".</p>
                <p>We all need a motivation for success. Without a reason for action we will take minimal if any action and will have little to know success.</p>
                <p>So, first things first. What is a "Why"?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="whatsWhy">
                <h6><a id="whatsWhy">What is a "why"?</a></h6>
                <p>We all have a why (or maybe 2 or 3) that inspires us and motivates us to push on when things get hard. At times it feels like there is a part of me that wants me to fail. A little voice in the back of my mind letting me know that I'm not good enough. It's at these times that it's important to remember my "why".</p>
                <p>The why is the overpowering voice that quites the one rooting for my failure. It says, "Remember Chris. There is a bigger picture here. Remember whats at stake here.</p>
                <p>Nothing in life is easy. Life is difficult and it's easy to get discouraged. Everybody does. Successful people have made it to the positions they have by listening to the "why" and keeping themselves from "all or nothing" thinking. We will fail at times and we will succeed at times. Are we going to remember why and pick up the tools where we left off, or submit to the negative thinking.</p>
                <p>If I want to be successful I have to remember why.</p>
                <p>Without a why there is no motivation for success. What fun is there in accomplishing something just for the sake of it. Why's come in all shapes and sizes and usually are related back to our basic needs for survival. It could be family, security, fun, finances, material possessions, fame, leadership, ad infidium.</p>

            <div class="myWhy">
                <h6><a id="myWhy">My Why</a></h6>
                <p>I tend to be a very grateful pearson. Gratitude for the things in my life whether family, possession, friends, or whatever it is I am so grateful to have what I do. Firstly, everything I do, I do for my family. Of course I want to enjoy material possessions, but to be able to afford goods and gifts for my family truely motivates me to change for the better. I came to Lambda in order to secure financial security for myself and my family. Knowing that I will have a skill set that will allow me to constantly support them keeps me motivated for Lambda school.</p>
                <p>I'm also inspired by success. I know that I am destined to be successful in life. I want to be able to show those that never believed in my that I can make it to the top. I want my family to be proud of me.</p>
                <p>Also, I crave certain material things. I love technology and having an income and a profession that will provide me with an income and skills to enjoy new technology</p>
            </div>
            <div class="conclusion">
                <h6><a id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h6>
                <p>I think it's pretty clear to see the necessity of the "why". When things get hard remembering that I am doing this for my family not just me keeps me on track. They are rellying on me to succeed in this so they can have the life I've always dreamed for them. Being able to afford a nice home for us all, to take my children on fun vacations, thinking about these things keeps me in check.</p>
                <p>Theres nothing wrong with getting down from time to time. Theres no problem with getting stressed out, but it's not ok to give up. Failure is not an option. Success is the only option. I like to keep reminders of my Why all around me, but every morning seeing my daughters beautiful smiling face is plenty motivation to keep pushing.</p>
